    "According to this assumption, which is difficult to refute, it is of interest to evaluate the possibility of creating new commercial premises such as restaurants or pizzerias (or other types not sufficiently widespread to serve users), especially in parts of the city that are deficient in this type of structure (both in quantity and quality)."

The logical combination of statistical information on the number of citizens and existing activities (also with an assessment of their degree of satisfaction) makes it possible to have an information pool of sure interest for the appropriate assessments."
